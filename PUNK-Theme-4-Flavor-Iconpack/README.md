Descriptions of the PUNK-Theme range from "easy to see," "slightly disturbed," "funky," "somehow elegant," "unhinged," "fun," "outrageous," to just "wow." They are probably all very correct statements.

This icon set showcases 4 color variations which exactly match their desktop-theme counterparts. Folders are also included.

The GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, GNOME-Shell, and Cinnamon desktop-theme is available for download via: https://www.opendesktop.org/p/1314525/

This Suru-grounded icon set was initially designed and developed by Sam Hewitt - under GPL3. The original Suru icon set and concept was created by Matthieu James - Canonical Design Team. Core developers are Andrea Bonanni (original author) and Gustavo Costa . Devices icons are inspired by La Capitaine created by Keefer Rourke - under GPL3/MIT. Emoji icons are derived from the Twenoji created by Twitter Team - under MIT. Some icons are based on Numix mimetypes icons created by the Numix Team - under GPL3. Devices and places icons and several apps icons are inspired by Papirus icons created by Alexey Varfolomeev - under GPL3. Numberless icons are from Gravit Designer, under GPL3/MIT.


Choose from any of the 4 individual icon theme files to download.

Manual Installation Is Easy:

1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.icons/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/icons/" folder - for the icons and folders to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable them for your desktop.

Logging out and then logging back in may be necessary on some operating systems to fully implement icon theme.
