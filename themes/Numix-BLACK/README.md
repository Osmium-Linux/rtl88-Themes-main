Numix-BLACK-Colors is a new GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, GNOME-Shell and Cinnamon dark-mode theme which showcases a color scheme that is highly readable and attractive. The theme represents a careful crafting of modernized Numix elements, which have been structurally modified to have a flatter look and lots of rounded corners - all aiming to bring a warm, colorful, and elegant experience to your desktop.

Black-on-black-on-black with one additional color just where you need it, Numix-BLACK-Colors yields the perfect dark-mode experience. Choose from Gold, Grape, Ice, Olive, Pomegranate, and Steel color varieties.


Tremendous thanks to the Numix team for inspiration, expertise and contributions at: "https://github.com/numixproject/". It is always a pleasure to be a part of any work you have advanced.

These Numix icons and folders have been carefully crafted to match the new Numix-BLACK-Colors desktop scheme, but they can surely compliment other desktop themes that sport matching color hues.


Manual Installation Is Easy for Numix-BLACK-Colors:

For themes: 1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.themes/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/themes/" folder - for the theme to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable it for your desktop.

If installing manually, make sure to install the dependency: "Murrine theme engine" if you do not already have it; and update your GTK+packages if you have not.

For icons: 1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.icons/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/icons/" folder - for the icons and folders to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable them for your desktop.

Logging out and then logging back in may be necessary on some operating systems to fully implement themes and icons.
