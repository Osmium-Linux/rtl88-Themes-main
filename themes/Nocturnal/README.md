Nocturnal, a GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, and GNOME-Shell - Dark Mode Theme. 

Tested for thousands of hours by serious coders - yielding extra-long hours of computer work, without any eyestrain. 

Nocturnal, for GTK, is the highly anticipated, and already highly-valued, color scheme for code editors, students, and those with light sensitivity issues.

Delivering a brand new GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, and GNOME-Shell dark-mode-scheme, this GUI-centric theme strictly adheres to hues proven to sooth hardworking eyes. Coders and GUI users, alike, are finding out that - once you try Nocturnal - it is hard to go back to anything else.

Nocturnal is designed for use with terminal and gui applications. It has several unique properties. The rtl88-Themes team designed this colorscheme with both precise CIELAB lightness relationships and a refined set of hues based on fixed color wheel relationships. It has been tested extensively in real world use on color calibrated displays (as well as uncalibrated/intentionally miscalibrated displays) and in a variety of lighting conditions.

The GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, and GNOME-Shell theme represents a careful blending of Arc elements.

Manual Installation Is Easy: 1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.themes/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/themes/" folder - for the theme to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable it for your desktop.

Logging out and then logging back in may be necessary on some operating systems, to fully implement themes.
