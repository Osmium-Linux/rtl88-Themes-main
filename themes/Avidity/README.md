Avidity is a new GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, GNOME-Shell, and Cinnamon- Dark Mode Theme.

The Avidity theme is based on Material Design standards and aims to bring a warm, lively, colorful, and elegant experience to your desktop. Adding Avidity icons to the desktop theme can enrich this effect for those who enjoy a semi-flat and minimalist icon theme, which still has plenty of vibrancy.

Manual Installation Is Easy:

1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.themes/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/themes/" folder - for the theme to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable it for your desktop.

If installing manually, make sure to install the dependency: "Murrine theme engine" if you do not already have it; and update your GTK+packages if you have not.

Logging out and then logging back in may be necessary on some operating systems to fully implement themes.
