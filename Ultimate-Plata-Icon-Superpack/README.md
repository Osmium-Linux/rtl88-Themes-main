These 11 icon themes match the GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, and GNOME-Shell theme: Ultimate-Plata. Plata is a new Gtk+ theme based on the latest Material Design refresh.

Ultimate-Plata mixes Dark-Chocolate, indigo, and shades of gray with bits of red, royal-blue, and violet - these icons and folders correspond to the constructs and hues presented in Plata

The GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, and GNOME-Shell theme represents a careful blending of Material Design refresh elements, in tandem with those of minimalist artist Rafa Capoci, icon designer Wojciech Kalinowski, the Papirus team, and full-stack web-developer/themer Pavel Agarkov, with an overlay of the precise Plata theming hues.

Choose from either the Icon-Superpack file or any of the 8 individual icon theme files to download (2 extra 'light only' icon themes are also included for download).

Manual Installation Is Easy:

1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.icons/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/icons/" folder - for the icons and folders to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable them for your desktop.

Logging out and then logging back in may be necessary on some operating systems to fully implement icon theme.
